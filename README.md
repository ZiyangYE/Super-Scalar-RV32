# Super-Scalar-RV32
Learn to design super scalar processors and use advanced HDLs. Design from scratch. For practice purposes only.

## Spec:
    RV32IM  
    2-Wide 3-Issue (Could be More Later)
    Out-of-Order Execution
    Use SpinalHDL  

### More Advanced Spec (probably):
    Support for Hardware Float
    Support for DRAM
    RO Based TRNG & DRAM Based PUF
    Support for NAND (Maybe Simplified to EMMC)

## Schedule
    No Schedule
